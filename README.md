# Day-Scheduler

This is a simple work day schedule application that allows users to save daily events in one hour time blocks between 9 AM and 5PM.

## Description

This application displays a standard 9-5 work day and allows the user to input text to organize objectives to complete within a workday. The application is organized in one hour time blocks between 9 AM and 5 PM and also is responsive to the current local time. Time blocks are color coded whether or not the time block is current, past, or future time block. Information entered into the Day-Scheduler is stored in local storage which is then automatically retrieved on page load.
